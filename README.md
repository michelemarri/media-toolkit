## Troubleshooting

### Connection Test Fails

1. Verify your AWS credentials are correct
2. Check that the IAM user has the required permissions
3. Ensure the bucket exists and is in the specified region
4. Check for any AWS service outages

### Files Not Uploading

1. Check the **Logs** page for error details
2. Verify PHP has sufficient memory and execution time
3. Ensure the file size doesn't exceed your S3 limits
4. Check that the plugin is properly configured

### CDN URLs Not Working

1. Verify the CDN URL is correct and accessible
2. Check that your CDN is properly configured to serve from S3
3. Ensure CORS is configured on your S3 bucket if needed
4. Verify SSL certificates are valid

### Migration Stops Unexpectedly

1. Check PHP max_execution_time setting
2. Increase WordPress memory limit if needed
3. Try reducing the batch size
4. Check server error logs for timeouts

### Image Optimization Issues

1. Ensure GD Library or ImageMagick is installed
2. Check file permissions on the uploads directory
3. Verify sufficient PHP memory for large images
4. Check the **Logs** page for specific errors

### Reconciliation Not Finding Files

1. Run **Sync S3 Stats** first to update the file list
2. Verify the environment setting matches where files are stored
3. Check that file paths match (wp-content/uploads structure)
4. Use **Scan S3** preview to see what will be matched

## Performance Recommendations

1. **Batch Size**: Start with smaller batches (10-25) for shared hosting
2. **Memory Limit**: Set to at least 256M for large operations
3. **S3 Stats Sync**: Daily sync is usually sufficient
4. **Cache-Control**: Use 1 year for immutable assets
5. **Image Optimization**: Process during low-traffic periods

## Changelog

- **New**: Batch size option of 1 image for granular progress updates
- **Improved**: AI metadata generation progress tracking

### 2.7.7
- **Improved**: S3 download validation for optimization
  - Now verifies file content is not empty before and after download
  - Checks file_put_contents actually wrote bytes
  - Verifies local file size matches S3 content length
